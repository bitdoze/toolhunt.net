Ever feel like the day slips away without you noticing? **Day Progress** is here to change that with a free, minimalist Mac app that lives in your menu bar and keeps you in tune with your time. Picture a tiny progress pie—or bar, your choice—quietly showing how much of your day is left, whether it’s a standard 9-to-5 or a night owl’s 3 PM to 3 AM grind. It’s not about overwhelming you with clocks or timers; it’s about a gentle, visual nudge to stay motivated and manage your hours. Customize your start and end times, peek at the percentage or minutes remaining, and even tie it into Shortcuts for some automation magic—like syncing with sunrise or setting quick presets.
