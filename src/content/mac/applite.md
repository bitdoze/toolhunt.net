## Frequently Asked Questions

### What apps are available on Applite?
Any application that can be found in the Homebrew Catalog is available through Applite. Use the search function to find specific applications.

### Is it secure?
macOS built-in protection (Gatekeeper and XProtect) will scan applications for potential malware. Most applications in the Homebrew Catalog are notarized by registered developers. However, applications are not sandboxed, so use caution, especially with less popular downloads.

### Can I use Applite with my existing Homebrew installation?
Yes! When you first open Applite, you can choose to use your existing Homebrew installation or create a new one specifically for Applite. If you choose a new installation, it will be stored at `~/Library/Application Support/Applite/homebrew`.

### What information does Applite track?
None. Applite is completely private and does not collect any user data or analytics.

Applite represents a new approach to application management on macOS - combining the power and flexibility of Homebrew with an accessible interface that anyone can use, all while respecting your privacy and giving you complete control over your software.
