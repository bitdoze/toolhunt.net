Say goodbye to the hassle of juggling app installs, updates, and uninstalls on your Mac. **Applite** is here to simplify it all with a free, open-source tool that puts you in control—no Terminal skills required. Built on the robust Homebrew package manager, Applite wraps its power in a sleek, beginner-friendly interface that feels right at home on macOS.

Whether you’re a casual user hunting for a new browser, a productivity buff streamlining your toolkit, or a developer grabbing coding libraries, Applite delivers thousands of apps with just a click. It’s private by design (zero tracking!), lightning-fast, and flexible enough to play nice with your existing Homebrew setup—or start fresh. Think of it as your Mac’s personal app assistant: intuitive, transparent, and ready to make software management a breeze.
