Picture this: you’re in the middle of a presentation, teaching a class, or walking a colleague through a design, and you need to point out something on your screen—fast. Enter **Annotate**, a free, open-source macOS tool that transforms your screen into a canvas for instant markups.

With a tap of a hotkey, you can draw arrows, highlight text, or drop numbered steps, all without breaking your flow. Built for speed and simplicity, this lightweight app is keyboard-driven, fully customizable, and packed with just the right tools to make your ideas pop.

Whether you’re a teacher circling key points, a designer sketching feedback, or a remote worker guiding a team, Annotate slips seamlessly into your workflow. It’s not bloated software—it’s a nimble, native Mac app that stays out of your way until you need it, then delivers with precision.

## Why You’ll Love It
- **Draw Anything, Anywhere**: Grab tools like pens, arrows, or highlighters to mark up your screen in seconds.
- **Keyboard Magic**: Switch tools with shortcuts (e.g., ‘p’ for pen, ‘h’ for highlight) for a smooth, mouse-free experience.
- **Fade or Stay**: Pick fade mode to let annotations vanish after a moment, or persist mode to keep them until you’re done.
- **Your Style, Your Way**: Customize shortcuts and colors to match how you work—red arrows today, blue circles tomorrow.
- **Always Ready**: Launch it from the menu bar or a global hotkey, no matter what app you’re in.

## What It Offers
- **Toolbox Variety**: Freehand pens, arrows, rectangles, circles, text, numbered counters—everything you need to explain visually.
- **Smart Modes**: Fade mode for temporary notes (great for live demos) or persist mode for detailed breakdowns.
- **Light & Fast**: Built natively for macOS, it runs smoothly without hogging resources.
- **Open-Source Perks**: Free under the MIT License, with a community keeping it fresh and bug-free.
